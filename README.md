### The quiz results
* When users click on the button "Get a flag" or tap on the image they get a new flag image shown randomly by JavaScript. 
* Then users type the country they think this flag belongs to and submit their answer. If the answer is correct, an alert pops up: "Well done! You got it right!" and the score of correct answers increases. If the answer is wrong, an alert pops up: "Awww... you answered... (user's answer). The correct country was ... (the correct country name)!" and the score of incorrect answers increases.
* The results and the score are easy to understand because correct answers are coloured green and wrong ones red.
