### The quiz results
* When users click on the button "Get a flag" or tap on the image they get a new flag image shown randomly by JavaScript. 
* Then users type the country they think this flag belongs to and submit their answer. If the answer is correct, an alert pops up: "Well done! You got it right!" and the score of correct answers increases. If the answer is wrong, an alert pops up: "Awww... you answered... (user's answer). The correct country was ... (the correct country name)!" and the score of incorrect answers increases.
* The results and the score are easy to understand because correct answers are coloured green and wrong ones red.

### Manual testing
#### I confirmed that the quiz results are always correct. I confirmed that all buttons and the input are clickable.

A new flag appears when the button is clicked. It also works if the image is clicked.

#### Empty input test
* Java Script code prevents submitting empty input. A pop-up appears with a request to type a country name.

### Bugs
On some mobile devices a space was added automatically to the name of the country which resulted in incrementing wrong answer. To fix this problem I used .trim() method. Now spaces don't cause any issues.

### Unfixed Bugs
No unfixed bugs.

## Deployment
The site was created using Gitpod and pushed to GitHub to a remote repository.
